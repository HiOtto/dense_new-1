This is the webpage of the open-source packages of our paper submitted to ICRA2016. Our implementation of dense tracking is built on the top of the open-source and vectorized implementation of [1]. Our package is compatible with the standard driver of VI-Sensor and ROS version of indigo. OpenCV is needed. ROS packages related to VI-sensor are needed, too. (https://github.com/ethz-asl/libvisensor and https://github.com/ethz-asl/visensor_node.git)

We have uploaded the experimental data shown in the video. All the raw data, estimatior output, UKF smoothing output, control command and etc. are included in the rosbags. To download it, please visit,
